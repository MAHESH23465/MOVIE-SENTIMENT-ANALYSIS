    "# üé• MOVIE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS\n",

    "**Author:** T.MAHESH\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Project Overview\n",
    "MOVIE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS is a text classification project that predicts whether a given movie review is **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.\n",
    "It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classification.\n",
    "The interface is built with **Gradio** to provide an interactive sentiment prediction tool that displays both the predicted label (with emoji) and the model's confidence as a bar chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìÇ How to Run\n",
    "1. **Install dependencies**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install gradio pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **Run the script**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python movie_sentiment_analysis.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Access the demo**\n",
    "   - If running locally: open the link shown in the terminal.\n",
    "   - If running with `share=True`, use the public Gradio share link.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Model Evaluation\n",
    "After training on the sample dataset:\n",
    "- **Train Accuracy**: ~X.XXX (will display from script output)\n",
    "- **Test Accuracy**: ~X.XXX (will display from script output)\n",
    "\n",
    "Model is trained on **TF-IDF features** (up to bigrams, max 3000 features) with **Logistic Regression**.\n",
    "Data is split **80% train / 20% test** with stratified sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Example Predictions\n",
    "| Review | Predicted Sentiment |\n",
    "|--------|--------------------|\n",
    "| I absolutely loved this movie, it was amazing! | üé¨ Positive |\n",
    "| This was the worst film I've ever seen | üí¢ Negative |\n",
    "| It was okay, not great but not bad | üòê Neutral |\n",
    "| Fantastic soundtrack and visuals | üé¨ Positive |\n",
    "| Boring and predictable storyline | üí¢ Negative |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Demo Predictions on Custom Inputs\n",
    "- **\"Heartwarming and beautifully shot\"** ‚Üí üé¨ Positive\n",
    "- **\"Predictable ending\"** ‚Üí üí¢ Negative\n",
    "- **\"Not bad, but I wouldn't watch again\"** ‚Üí üòê Neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Conclusion\n",
    "The **MOVIE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS** project demonstrates how natural language processing techniques can be applied to determine the sentiment of movie reviews.\n",
    "By combining **TF-IDF vectorization** with **Logistic Regression**, we achieve a reasonable balance between accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "The Gradio interface makes it easy for users to interact with the model, visualize its confidence, and understand predictions in an intuitive way.\n"
